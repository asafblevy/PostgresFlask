### Kubernetes and helm chart installation instructions ###
To get kubernetes to work you first have to install docker
Follow the installation instructions for your OS type on the following site:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

After installing the docker engine you would have to get a kubernetes environment to run the project on:
For this project I chose minikube, the project should work on any other kubernetes environment you choose to use.
To install minikube follow the instructions on this page:
https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
Make sure you can run kubectl commands to make sure the next steps work:
for example try running "kubectl get pods"

Now you would have to install helm, the package manager which will get the whole project set up.
Go to this page and follow the instructions:
https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/
To make sure helm is installed run the command - helm version and make sure youre not getting any errors
